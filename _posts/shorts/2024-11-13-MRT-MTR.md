People who have once been to both Hong Kong and Singapore must be confused by how to distinguish MTR and MRT. The only difference is in the word order, and it is easy to mix up without long-term stay.

Luckily, MRT is not the only transportation business. There are also SBS.

But do you know there's also a restaurant in Singapore named MTR Singapore? (near NE8: Farrer Park)
